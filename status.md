Shlithering Shnakes

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We were able to make the screen, the shnake, food 1 & 2, keyboard controls, updating the score when the shnake eats a food, and adding square body to the shnake whenever it eats food. 


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Extra Shnkae

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Loading pygame has been a problem for some of my partners so we are using just turtles instead. 
Our group struggled to make the CPU shnake move randomly so we have decided to make it two players user controlled for both.
