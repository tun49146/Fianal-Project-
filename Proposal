# Proposal
 
## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
 
Shlithering Shnakes
 
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A game where there is a CPU shnake and a user shnake eating food to get bigger before getting knocked out.
 
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
A game where the user controls a shnake and eats apples to get longer. There will also be a CPU shnake roaming around and the game ends when the user's shnake runs into the CPU shnake or side.
 
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
None
 
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
 
We will accomplish a working shnake for the user no matter what. 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
 
A better outcome for our final project is a working shnake for the user that can feed off of food. I think that our group will be able to achieve the best outcome. 
 
 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
 
The best outcome for our final project is a fully working CPU snake where it moves around itself to consume food. The food shows up in multiple colors and a fully controllable snake that can be controlled by the user.
 
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
 
We will need to download and learn how to use pygame. We will also have to learn the timing commands and the clock function. Overall, this game will use a lot of loops and drawing a grid and the main struggle will just be learning how to develop a game in general. We will also have to figure out the distance between each x value and each y value when drawing the snake and cubes. We have not decided who will do what, but we will figure it out with multiple parts such as producing the grid, the snake body, the food(cubes), the snake CPU, and etc.
